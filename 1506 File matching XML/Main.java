/*
Recreate your solution for Exercise 15.5 using XML serialization.  You may want to create applications to read the data stored in the .xml files - the code in Section 15.5.2 can be modified for this purpose.

// My notes:  I interpret this as asking for the Account data to be stored in XML files, so I just have to make oldmast.txt, newmast.txt, and trans.txt into xml files.
After working with this for a bit, I have learned that the book uses deprecated code to read and write XML files, so I had to get most of the help I needed for this solution from the internet.
