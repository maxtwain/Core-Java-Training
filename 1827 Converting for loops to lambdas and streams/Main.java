/*
Each of the counter controlled for loops we used in this chapter's examples can be implemented using IntStream's rangeClosed method to produce a range of values, then using IntStream's forEach method to specify a lambda to execute for each value.  The lambda argument to forEach could, for example, call method factorial (Figs. 18.3-18.4) or method fibonacci (Fig. 18.5) and display the result.

My notes:  It seems this is not an exercise.
