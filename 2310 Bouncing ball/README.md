# Exercise 23.10: Bouncing Ball

Write a program that uses the JavaFX threading techniques introduced in this chapter to bounce a blue ball inside a Pane.  The ball should begin moving in a random direction from the point where the user clicks the mouse.  When the ball hits the edge of the Pane, it should bounce off the edge and continue in the opposite direction.

 My notes: I've studied JavaFX for two previous chapters, but I have to say that I do not agree with the way this book teaches it.  As such, I am now endeavoring to avoid the rest of JavaFX in this book.  I will be skipping this exercise as well as exercises 11 and 12.
